## Copernicus  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/copernet/copernicus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/copernet/copernicus)

Copernicus is an alternative implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, written in Golang .

Why Go? Go has the following advantages:

* Multi-platform compilation
* Simple deployment, direct compilation to machine code
* High performance
* Built-in support for high concurrency
* Garbage Collection
* Rich standard library
* Static type
* Type judgment
* C support friendly
* Clean code 
* Go is a well-designed programming language , eg: Code Style , Tool Chain ...


A driven team of architects are heading the development, we welcome all developers to join the development of Bitcoin Golang, to contribute to the Bitcoin Golang Community.
