* High performance
* Built-in support for high concurrency
* Garbage Collection
* Rich standard library
* Static type
* Type judgment
* C support friendly
* Clean code 
* Go is a well-designed programming language , eg: Code Style , Tool Chain ...
* ...

A driven team of architects are heading the development, we welcome all developers to join the development of Bitcoin to contribute to the Bitcoin Community.
